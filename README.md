The expert talk on food and wellness made me realize how important it is to take care of our health, especially when we are starting a new phase of life. I will definitely try to eat healthier from now on.
* The GitHub session was also very interesting. I had never used GitHub before, but with the help of our seniors, I created my account and made my first repository. It made me feel like I’ve taken my first small step into the world of coding and development. I was nervous at first, but now I feel more confident and motivated.
* I’m really thankful to the college, teachers, and seniors for putting so much effort into making us feel comfortable and helping us learn from the very beginning.

## Day 3 
## Lecture by Dr.Jaswinder Singh Sir
* Day 3 of our induction program began with a very interesting and inspiring expert lecture by Dr. Jaswinder Singh sir, who is the retired incharge of IAPT (Indian Association of Physics Teachers). He delivered a unique session that beautifully connected Physics, Mathematics, and spiritual values. As a first-year student, I found this lecture very engaging and full of learning.
  Sir explained various concepts of physics and maths through simple and fun tricks and experiments which made learning more enjoyable and easier to understand. It was not just about formulas or theories – he showed us how these subjects are actually connected to our daily lives. The best part was how he also connected the teachings of Gurbani with scientific knowledge, which gave us a new perspective on life, values, and learning.
  Dr. Jaswinder Singh’s way of teaching was very motivating. He encouraged us to think logically, stay curious, and always look for answers. His energy and passion made the lecture more enjoyable. I truly liked and enjoyed his session.
  
* The Chief Guest, S. Gurcharan Singh Grewal, Secretary of SGPC, also motivated us with his inspiring speech. He appreciated Dr. Jaswinder Singh for his valuable contribution in spreading scientific knowledge through engaging experiments and linking it with spiritual values. He also thanked him for fulfilling his responsbilities so well.
## Universal human values 
* After that, we attended an expert lecture by Dr. Priya Darshni Mam on Universal Human Values. She beautifully explained the importance of values in our personal and professional lives. Through her interactive session, we learned how values like respect, honesty, compassion, and responsibility help us become better human beings.
* She also told us about the importance of right understanding in life and how it is related to physical facilities. She explained that if we develop the right understanding, then only we can manage our relationships and physical needs properly. Physical facilities alone are not enough for a happy life. If someone has all the physical comforts but lacks good relationships, they still can't stay truly happy.
* She also explained the difference between happiness and excitement. Happiness is something that stays with us for a long time – it is stable and continuous. On the other hand, excitement is temporary – it lasts for a few moments and then fades away.
## Assignment
* She also gave us assignment on "How much time and effort you put in everyday in these 3 areas(Relationship, Physical facility and Right understanding ) other than for sleeping (say 8 hours)"?
* I spend 1.5 hours on Right understanding, 9.5 hours on Physical facilities, 2.5 hours on Relationship and 2.5 hours on other miscellaneous activities.
* Throw this I realised that most of my time goes into studies physical related things like eating , watching pak dramas , netflix etc. I am giving some time to family and friends but I think , I can improve a bit in the Right understanding area like spending more time in self reflection , reading meaningful content or meditation . This exercise really helped me realize how much my day is structured and then i can make it better 
## Reflection 
* Overall, it was a day full of motivation, learning, and self-reflection. The sessions not only boosted our academic thinking but also helped us understand the deep connection between knowledge and human values. As a fresher, it was a new and eye-opening experience to see how subjects like Physics and Mathematics can be taught with such passion and meaning. It also made me realize how important it is to build strong moral values along with technical skills. These teachings will definitely help us become more responsible, confident, and balanced individuals as we begin our journey in college life. I feel grateful to be a part of this induction program.

She talked about the Program for Fulfillment of Basic Human Aspirations, focusing on the two key aspects every human being wants – happiness and prosperity. She explained that for long-lasting happiness, we need right understanding, not just physical facilities or temporary pleasures.
* Mam discussed the importance of balancing three main areas in life – Right Understanding (in the Self), Relationship (with human beings), and Physical Facility (with rest of nature). These three together help us live in harmony, and achieve mutual happiness and mutual prosperity.
* Mam showed how chasing temporary pleasure can lead to excitement at first, but then to depression and stress, especially when there is disharmony within the Self. She encouraged us to focus on continuous happiness which comes from right feelings, right understanding, and responsibility.
* In the end, she told us not to blindly believe everything, but to verify each proposal based on our own natural acceptance – a very empowering message for all of us as students. I found the session deeply thoughtful, and it helped me look at life in a new and positive way.

## Day 8
### Millets-The super power 
* Day 8 started with an extremely informative and engaging lecture by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar mam on the topic "Millets – The Super Power". She began by telling us about the history of millets, explaining how they have been a part of traditional diets for thousands of years but are now regaining popularity due to their amazing health benefits. She explained that millets are packed with nutrients like protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making them a complete food for overall wellness. She also told us how they are naturally gluten-free, which makes them suitable for people with gluten intolerance.
* Mrs. Shaffy mam shared that millets not only improve digestion and boost immunity but also help in controlling blood sugar levels and maintaining a healthy weight. She emphasized their role in reducing the risk of lifestyle diseases like diabetes and heart problems. In addition to health benefits, she highlighted their environmental advantages — they require less water, grow well in dry regions, and are more resilient to climate changes compared to other grains like wheat or rice. This makes them a sustainable crop that supports both human health and the planet.
* The session also included some interesting tips on how to include millets in our daily meals — from making millet porridge for breakfast to preparing rotis, khichdi, and even healthy snacks. She encouraged us to experiment with millet-based recipes and shared that many popular dishes can be made healthier by replacing refined grains with millets.
* As a first-year fresher student, I found the lecture extremely valuable. It not only gave me knowledge about a superfood I had overlooked but also inspired me to make small but impactful changes in my eating habits. I realized that adopting millets is not just about healthy eating but also about supporting farmers, saving water, and caring for our environment.

Her way of teaching made the subject feel more interesting and less intimidating. As a fresher, I felt motivated to approach maths not just as an academic requirement but as a life skill that will always be useful.
## Reflection 
* As a first-year fresher student, Day 8 was a day full of learning and inspiration. The lecture by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar mam on “Millets – The Super Power” gave me valuable knowledge about the importance of millets for both our health and the environment. I learned how such small grains can have such a big impact, and it motivated me to think about making healthier food choices.
