 They also explained that GitHub is very useful for students like us, especially in coding and teamwork. It helps us save our code safely, track changes, and work together on projects. It’s also good for building our profile, which can help us later in internships or placements. I really found it interesting because it was my first time using such a platform or coding app.
 ## Reflections 
 * Overall, I really enjoyed Day 2 of the induction program and learned many new things. As a first-year student, everything feels new and exciting to me. Today’s sessions helped me understand how many opportunities and resources are available in our college. The scholarship session gave hope to students who need financial support, and I found it really inspiring. The expert talk on food and wellness made me realize how important it is to take care of our health, especially when we are starting a new phase of life. I will definitely try to eat healthier from now on.
* The GitHub session was also very interesting. I had never used GitHub before, but with the help of our seniors, I created my account and made my first repository. It made me feel like I’ve taken my first small step into the world of coding and development. I was nervous at first, but now I feel more confident and motivated.
* I’m really thankful to the college, teachers, and seniors for putting so much effort into making us feel comfortable and helping us learn from the very beginning. I feel proud to be a part of this college, and I’m looking forward to the upcoming days of the induction program with great excitement.

## Day 3 
## Lecture by Dr.Jaswinder Singh Sir
* Day 3 of our induction program began with a very interesting and inspiring expert lecture by Dr. Jaswinder Singh sir, who is the retired incharge of IAPT (Indian Association of Physics Teachers). He delivered a unique session that beautifully connected Physics, Mathematics, and spiritual values. As a first-year student, I found this lecture very engaging and full of learning.
  Sir explained various concepts of physics and maths through simple and fun tricks and experiments which made learning more enjoyable and easier to understand. It was not just about formulas or theories – he showed us how these subjects are actually connected to our daily lives. The best part was how he also connected the teachings of Gurbani with scientific knowledge, which gave us a new perspective on life, values, and learning.
  Dr. Jaswinder Singh’s way of teaching was very motivating. He encouraged us to think logically, stay curious, and always look for answers. His energy and passion made the lecture more enjoyable. I truly liked and enjoyed his session.
  
* The Chief Guest, S. Gurcharan Singh Grewal, Secretary of SGPC, also motivated us with his inspiring speech. He appreciated Dr. Jaswinder Singh for his valuable contribution in spreading scientific knowledge through engaging experiments and linking it with spiritual values. He also thanked him for fulfilling his responsbilities so well.
## Universal human values 
* After that, we attended an expert lecture by Dr. Priya Darshni Mam on Universal Human Values. She beautifully explained the importance of values in our personal and professional lives. Through her interactive session, we learned how values like respect, honesty, compassion, and responsibility help us become better human beings.
* She also told us about the importance of right understanding in life and how it is related to physical facilities. She explained that if we develop the right understanding, then only we can manage our relationships and physical needs properly. Physical facilities alone are not enough for a happy life. If someone has all the physical comforts but lacks good relationships, they still can't stay truly happy.
* She also explained the difference between happiness and excitement. Happiness is something that stays with us for a long time – it is stable and continuous. On the other hand, excitement is temporary – it lasts for a few moments and then fades away.
## Assignment
* She also gave us assignment on "How much time and effort you put in everyday in these 3 areas(Relationship, Physical facility and Right understanding ) other than for sleeping (say 8 hours)"?
* I spend 1.5 hours on Right understanding, 9.5 hours on Physical facilities, 2.5 hours on Relationship and 2.5 hours on other miscellaneous activities.
* Throw this I realised that most of my time goes into studies physical related things like eating , watching pak dramas , netflix etc. I am giving some time to family and friends but I think , I can improve a bit in the Right understanding area like spending more time in self reflection , reading meaningful content or meditation . This exercise really helped me realize how much my day is structured and then i can make it better 
## Reflection 
* Overall, it was a day full of motivation, learning, and self-reflection. The sessions not only boosted our academic thinking but also helped us understand the deep connection between knowledge and human values. As a fresher, it was a new and eye-opening experience to see how subjects like Physics and Mathematics can be taught with such passion and meaning. It also made me realize how important it is to build strong moral values along with technical skills. These teachings will definitely help us become more responsible, confident, and balanced individuals as we begin our journey in college life. I feel grateful to be a part of this induction program.
## Day 4 
### lectures 
* Day 4 of our induction program began with a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) lecture delivered by our senior, Kusum di. She explained everything very clearly and in a friendly manner, which made it easy for us to understand. The session was mainly focused on programming, especially in C++. She introduced us to the basic concepts of C++ and also demonstrated some simple coding examples. Through her guidance, we got a better idea of how programming works and how we can start building our logic. It was a very helpful session for us as freshers, and we truly appreciated her efforts in making us feel comfortable with a new subject.
* Then, after the above lecture, we attended a session on BEEE (Basic Electrical and Electronics Engineering) by Prof. Harminder Kaur Ma’am from the ECE department. In the beginning, Mam interacted with us and took our introduction one by one. She also asked us about our strengths and weaknesses, which made the session more engaging and interactive. After that, she gave us a brief introduction to the subject and explained what topics we will study throughout the semester. It helped us understand the scope and importance of BEEE in our engineering journey. As first-year students, it was a good start to get familiar with the subject structure and what to expect in future classes.
### Lecture on Universal Human Values by Dr. Priya Darshni Ma'am

* After the break, we had a very insightful and meaningful lecture on Universal Human Values (UHV) by Dr. Priya Darshni Mam. She talked about the Program for Fulfillment of Basic Human Aspirations, focusing on the two key aspects every human being wants – happiness and prosperity. She explained that for long-lasting happiness, we need right understanding, not just physical facilities or temporary pleasures.
* Mam discussed the importance of balancing three main areas in life – Right Understanding (in the Self), Relationship (with human beings), and Physical Facility (with rest of nature). These three together help us live in harmony, and achieve mutual happiness and mutual prosperity.
* Mam showed how chasing temporary pleasure can lead to excitement at first, but then to depression and stress, especially when there is disharmony within the Self. She encouraged us to focus on continuous happiness which comes from right feelings, right understanding, and responsibility.
* In the end, she told us not to blindly believe everything, but to verify each proposal based on our own natural acceptance – a very empowering message for all of us as students. I found the session deeply thoughtful, and it helped me look at life in a new and positive way.
### Causmic club 
* After that, we were introduced to the Causmic Club of our college. The members of the club gave us a brief overview of what the club is all about and the various activities they organize throughout the year. They told us that the Causmic Club is focused on technical and creative development and provides a platform for students to showcase their talents in different fields. They also explained the types of events they conduct, such as competitions, workshops, and fests. We also came to know about the sponsors who support the club and help in organizing large-scale events. It was a great introduction, and it made many of us excited to participate and become part of such active student communities in the future.
